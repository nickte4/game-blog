          The game opens with a wooden diner and a large open window that
          provides an invisible barrier between the people inside and the
          streets of Lost Heaven. Tommy Angelo, a mobster of the Salieri family,
          describes his nights of debauchery and crime to a hesitant detective.
          Each event described acts as a campaign mission and the overall story
          mode is quite linear.

          <br />
          Like any good mobster movie, Mafia is about the rise and fall of
          Angelo's run in the mafia-- from his first getaway drive in a cab to
          the final shotgun blast that lays him to rest six feet in the ground.

          So you know those Scorcese mafia thriller movies with Robert De Niro
          and Joe Pesci? That's essentially the experience you're getting. The
          game draws a clear line in the sand between the decadent moments of
          booze and nice cars to the gruesome assassinations carried out by
          Angelo and his gang.

          The gameplay is clean, the graphics are beautiful, and the driving is
          engaging to say the least. The radio is nice and adds to the vibe of
          the game-- but I feel that Mafia 2 does a better job of aligning the
          soundtrack to the current era's vibe.

            A noir mode is available in the game which paints the town in black
            and white.

            There's an infamous race mission that was notoriously difficult in
            the original 2002 release of this game. The same mission can be
            found. With the same level of irritable difficulty.
